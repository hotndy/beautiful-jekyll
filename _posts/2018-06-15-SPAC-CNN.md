Rain impedes outdoor vision for both human and cameras. Current vision solutions under rainy whether either has limitations to torrential rain with large and opaque rain streak occlusions, or faces challenges with fast moving cameras (30km/h above) on dynamic scenes. In this project, we propose a robust and efficient vision enhancement framework that can address all these challenging issues.
