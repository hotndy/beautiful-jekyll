The light field is a vector function that describes the amount 42 of light propagating in every direction through every point 43 in space [1]. As illustrated in Fig. 1, light field is usually 44 represented as four-dimensional data: L(x, y, s, t), in which 45 (x, y) is at the micro-lens array plane (which is near the 46 focal plane of the main lens); and (s, t) is at the camera main 47 lens plane. The four parameters at two planes can sufficiently 48 describe the propagation of all light rays in the imaging 49 system.
