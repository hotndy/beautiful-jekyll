We present a video synthetic rain dataset. \[[download](https://github.com/hotndy/SPAC-SupplementaryMaterials)\]

The data category (i.e., training/testing data, and whether the rain is synthetic/real rain), the camera motion (i.e., slow/fast
moving cameras), as well as the labeling details for each data is shown in the table below.
